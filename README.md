# Personal Finance Tracker - Week 1 Intro to Mobile class.

## Overview
I created this Personal Finance Tracking application for this Intro to Mobile class I am taking this summer at MSTC, it's a .NET MAUI application designed to help users manage their finances by tracking transactions and budgets. The goal is for it to feature a user-friendly interface to add transactions and budgets, view detailed reports with custom charts, and navigate between pages seamlessly.

## Features
- Add and manage transactions (income and expenses) with categories and notes.
- Set and track monthly budgets for various categories.
- View detailed transaction information.
- Generate reports with bar charts for category spending and line charts for monthly trends.
- Responsive design across Android, iOS, macCatalyst, and Windows platforms.

## Usage
- Navigate to the **MainPage** to view transactions and budgets.
- Use **Add Transaction** and **Add Budget** pages to input new entries.
- Check **ReportsPage** for visual insights into your finances.
- View transaction details on the **DetailPage**.
